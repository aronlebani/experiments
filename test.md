# Hello, world!

I am written in markdown. I am (hopefully) going to be converted to a nice, pretty, Tex pdf.

Here is some code for good measure.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

* Let's
* hope
* this
* works!

Okay, bye for now :)
